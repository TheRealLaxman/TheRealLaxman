👋 Hi, I'm **Laxman**!  
💻 I'm a passionate **Web Developer** with a focus on **JavaScript**. Currently learning and experimenting with all things JS to make the web more interactive, one line of code at a time.  

🎓 I'm a **B.Tech student**.  

### Skills:
- **Languages**: C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (currently obsessed with JS!)

### 🚀 Ongoing Projects:
- Building a **web app** using JavaScript (still a work in progress, but getting there)
- Deep diving into **asynchronous programming** (I promise I’ll conquer callbacks soon!)

### 📌 What I’m up to lately:
- Trying to **master JavaScript** (closures are my current challenge, but I’ll crack it!)

P.S. If you have any tips on making JavaScript less confusing, feel free to share! Also, if you know any **coding memes**, send them my way. Let's keep the vibes fun! 😄
