👋 Hi, I'm **Laxman**!  
💻 I'm a passionate **Web Developer** with a love for JavaScript. Currently diving deep into the world of **JS** (because who doesn't want to tame the beast? 😜). Learning new tricks and tools to make the web more interactive, one line of code at a time.  

🎓 Currently a **B.Tech student** (yep, still figuring out how to balance coding with college assignments 😅).  

### Skills:
- **Languages**: C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (lots of JS lately!)
- **Frameworks**: Node.js (because server-side is cool, right?)
  
### 🚀 Ongoing Projects:
- Building a **web app** using Node.js and JS (just don't ask me if it’s ready yet 😂)
- Exploring the mysteries of **asynchronous programming** (I swear, callbacks are like that one annoying relative that you can never escape)

### 📌 What I’m up to lately:
- Trying to **master JavaScript** (still stuck on closures, but I’m getting there!)
- Binge-watching web dev tutorials while pretending to study for exams (don’t tell my professors!)

P.S. If you have any tips on making JavaScript less confusing, I’m all ears! Also, if you know any good **coding memes**, feel free to send them my way—let’s keep the vibes fun. 😄
